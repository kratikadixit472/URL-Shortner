# URL-Shortner
How It Works (Briefly) URLs are stored in a database and are associated with an unique numerical id that functions as a primary key. This id is in decimal (base 10) format, but it can be more succinctly represented in a higher base. PHP is able to convert to base 36, which uses all the numerical digits as well as the Latin alphabet [0-9,A-Z].  URLs are therefore associated with the base 36 representation of their numerical primary key, allowing them to be represented in a concise manner.
